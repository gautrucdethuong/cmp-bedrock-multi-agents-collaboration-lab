    "In this notebook we show you how to create your second sub-agent on Amazon Bedrock Agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent contains instructions on how to install and to do maintenance on Solar Panels, where customers can ask the agent to return these information from an [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To equip foundation models (FMs) with up-to-date and proprietary information, organizations use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that fetches data from company data sources and enriches the prompt to provide more relevant and accurate responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is Bedrock's fully managed capability that helps you implement the entire RAG workflow from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation without having to build custom integrations to data sources and manage data flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our agent, if the answer to a question is not present on the Knowledge Base, customers can ask agent to create a support ticket, to get a human in the loop to help with their questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following represents the piece of architecture that will be built on this module.\n",
